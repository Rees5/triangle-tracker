| Behaviour| Input Example | Output Example |

| A triangle is Equilateral<br><li>All sides are equal</li> | <li>a=5</li><li>b=5</li><li>c=5</li> | Equilateral Triangle |
| A triangle is Isosceles<br><li>Either of the two sides are equal</li> | <li>a=5</li><li>b=5</li><li>c=6</li> | Isosceles Triangle |
| A triangle is scalene<br><li>None of the sides are equal</li><li>Sum of any two sides is greater than the remainng side</li>| <li>a=4</li><li>b=5</li><li>c=6</li> | Scalene Triangle |
| Triangle with either of the two sides <br>summation less than or equal to the third remaining side | <li>a=4</li><li>b=6</li><li>c=12</li> | NOT a triangle at all |
