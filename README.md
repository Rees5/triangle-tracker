| A triangle is scalene | <li>a=4</li><li>b=5</li><li>c=6</li> | Scalene Triangle |
| Triangle with two equal sides whose <br>summation is less than the third side | <li>a=5</li><li>b=5</li><li>c=11</li> | NOT a Triangle at all |
| Triangle with either of the two sides <br>summation less than the third side | <li>a=4</li><li>b=6</li><li>c=12</li> | NOT a triangle at all |
